            <p>Close. It's gonna make your kidneys shut down. Want to piss on him? I'll tell you how I feel about school, Jerry. It's a waste of time. Bunch of people runnin' around bumpin' into each other, got a guy up front says, '2 + 2,' and the people in the back say, '4.' Then the bell rings and they give you a carton of milk and a piece of paper that says you can go take a dump or somethin'. I mean, it's not a place for smart people, Jerry. I know that's not a popular opinion, but that's my two cents on the issue. There is no god, Summer; gotta rip that band-aid off now you'll thank me later. </p>

            <p>Don't break an arm jerking yourself off Morty. I'm your worst nightmare, bitch! What about the reality where Hitler cured cancer, Morty? The answer is: Don't think about it. Well I don't like your unemployed genes in my grandchildren, Jerry. </p>

            <h5>What is this, 90's Conan? Alan Rails, ladies and gentlemen.</h5>
            <p> After his parents' tragic death in a railroad accident, he gained the power to summon ghost trains. It's not all bad though, they were spared having to see their grown son wear a whistle. It's a device Morty, that when you put it in your ear, you can enter people's dreams Morty. Its just like that movie that you keep crowing about. Are you hungry for apples? ARE YOU HUNGRY FOR APPLESSS!?</p>
